This project consists of a website in which there are 3 recipes. It is built using basic html knowledge. 
By building this project, I could consolidate my understandings about the basics of html (the boilerplate, images, links) and even more important, I began to be more comfortable in using Git commands and the commands line to navigate in the directories.
